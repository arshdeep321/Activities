     <p>Hello dear students, <br><br>
        We all know being fit and healthy is a every person dream and there are many people who are willing to do different activities in order to get fit. Some people are going to gym and others are playing some sports which is a good way. However there are some people who don't know what to do. Which activity they should choose and they end up spending there free time in home looking at their phone or laptop screen. Thats why our Hochschule have decided to offer their students number of sports and activities that the students can do in their free time. <br> <br>
        Their are number of activities to choose from and its a good way to keep healthy and also have contact with other students having same interests. These events will be happening every week one or two times depending upon the popularity of a sport or activity. 
        <br> <br>
        Intereseted students can login themselves using Login button and can see the timetable when is happening a particular event and just show up there on that day. So students have fun with your favourite sport.
